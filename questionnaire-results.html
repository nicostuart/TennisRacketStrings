I recommend tightening this to 45 to 50 lbs, but you will certainly want to experiment a little bit before landing on a tension.",
            "Natural Gut": "I recommend you check out the Gamma (natural) Gut 16s. These are a great choice for a much more comfortable and forgiving experience. You can also expect to get some serious power output out of these. Be sure to also purchase a racket cover as these strings can be quite sensitive to moisture!",
            "Synthetic Gut": "I recommend you get the Prince Synthetic Gut 17s. It is great for beginner and intermediate tennis players and is truly one of the most solid all-around tennis strings that is available for purchase. No wonder it is so highly popular right now! It is also a very affordable option and a terrific starting place!",
            "Multifilament": "I recommend you get the NXT 16s multifilament strings from Wilson. One of the best name-brand companies in the tennis racket business, this string has been recommended to me numerous times. In fact, I actually used this string for many years while in middle school! This will give you a softer touch, akin to the natural gut while also providing more tension maintenance, giving you some of the best of both worlds!"
