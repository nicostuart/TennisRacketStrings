            <p>
                My name is Nico Stuart, and I am a current senior at WashU studying Business and Computer Science.
                Outside of the classroom, I find myself engaged with numerous extracurricular activities, including the
                ski club, engineering teaching assistant work, volunteer running with the visually impaired, intramural
                tennis and
                more!
                <br>
                <br>
                Since I was young, I have thoroughly enjoyed many high-energy activities and sports. The quick pace of
                tennis naturally drew me in quite quickly. What's more, I appreciated the ability tennis offered me to
                play conversationally as well as competitively. In other words, I could casually rally and hit the ball
                back and forth with my parents while talking and catching up with them. At the same time, I could walk
                on a court while on the highschool tennis team with competitive spirits high, and put my full effort
                into every shot.
                <br>
                <br>
                Tennis offered me the best of both worlds.

            </div>
            <p>
                Throughout my life I have had a passion for coding (particularly website development and video game
                development) as well as the sport of tennis. In considering topics to research, I came accross a report
                by the US Tennis Association. The report attempted to depict the growing nature of tennis, highlighting
                that a record-breaking roughly 25.1 million Americans, ages 6 and older who didn't play tennis in 2023
                were "very interested" in dong so now <a
                    href="https://www.usta.com/content/dam/usta/2024-pdfs/national-tennis-participation-report.pdf">[1]</a>.
                What's immediately clear, is that the sport will continue to see significant growth in the in the near
                future.
                <br>
                <br>
                While growth for the sport is certainly beneficial in many ways (for example, the report further
                stated that massive investment in new technologies will likely supplement the growing player base), new
                players who pick up the sport will need to purchase tennis rackets and strings to suit their play.<i><b>
                        I
                        recognized the need for a centralized website that was both informative and one that produced a
                        tangible
                        reccomendation, hopefully eliminating the step of receiving outside consultation for the tennis
                        racket string purchases.</b></i>
                <br>
                <br>
                I have worked hard to produce a website that is not only simple and easy to use, but also has some
                interactivity. I suspect as a prospective player reads this website, her anticipation will steadily
                build to get out on the court - and to solve that, I want to make this site enjoyable to interact with!
