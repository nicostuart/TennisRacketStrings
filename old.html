                <p>
                    If you play classical guitar, whether you are just starting out or have been playing forever, you probably
                    know that choosing strings is an incredibly daunting task. By the time you sift through other types of
                    guitar strings, like electric and acoustic, you are still left with a plethora of options. Then after you
                    finally decide on a brand, you have to decide what model you would actually like to buy. Do different
                    strings really make that much of a difference though? The short answer is yes. The different characteristics
                    you run into on string packages do make a difference in how your guitar will feel and sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where are you even supposed to begin though? To simplify things, we will focus on D’Addario strings,
                    specifically their standard <a
                        href="https://www.daddario.com/products/guitar/classical-guitar/pro-arte-nylon/">Pro Arté Nylon Core</a>
                    models. Known as a reliable string among many guitarists and offering multiple variations, they serve as a
                    great example to study the nuances in guitar string sound and feel.

                    <h3>How Strings Work</h3>
                    <p>
                        First, though,we will look at how all strings work. Strings work by vibrating, and then the frequency of
                        this vibration determines the pitch <a href="#source1">[1]</a>. While you do not need to memorize the
                        exact details, it should not be taken for granted that this vibration creates the sound. For example,
                        your ability to play an E on the guitar will not change whether you know the frequency of open E on the
                        first string or not. However, knowing this fact provides more context for why things like tension and
                        material do matter for the way a string produces sound. It is especially important to note that higher frequency vibrations cause higher pitches, and lower frequency vibrations cause lower pitches.

                <h2>MATERIALS</h2>
                <p>
                    First we’ll look at material. D’Addario Pro Arté Nylon Core strings break this up into two categories:
                    treble strings and bass strings <a href="#source2">[2]</a>. Treble strings consist of the three highest
                    strings on a guitar. From highest to lowest, their pitches are E, B, and G, which are the first, second, and
                    third strings respectively. Then, the bass strings include the three lowest strings. These strings’ pitches
                    are D, A, and E, for the fourth, fifth, and sixth strings.
                </p>

                <div id="treble">
                    <h3>Treble Strings</h3>
                    <img class = "small-img" src = "strings-images/nylon-string.jpg">
                    <p class = "small-img caption">Close up of treble string.</p>
                    <p>
                        To make treble strings, a machine extrudes out nylon in the exact diameter each string needs to be so
                        that its vibration works properly for its pitch at the correct tension level <a href="#source3">[3]</a>
                        (which we’ll cover later). D’Addario makes these in clear nylon and black nylon <a
                            href="#source2">[2]</a>. Clear nylon is D’Addario’s basic, nylon polymer, and black nylon is that
                        same base material with some black dye added in <a href="#source3">[3]</a>. So, while very similar, the
                        addition of black dye to nylon actually changes the string’s composition just enough for there to be
                        differences in tone, clarity, articulation, and stretchiness <a href="#source4">[4]</a>. However, as an
                        overall sturdy material, both clear and black nylon can hold up against corrosion from external factors,
                        especially moisture from a room’s humidity or your hands’ sweat. To see a side by side of these factors,
                        see the table below.

                    <p>
                        Every guitarist has their own preference for tone, so depending on what sound you like best, either
                        treble option can be favored. The same thing goes for stretchiness, since this tends to be more
                        subjective from player to player. However, clear nylon provides higher clarity and more articulation,
                        which makes it a more high quality string for most guitarists (unless you are attached to the tone that
                        black nylon produces).
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="bass">
                    <h3>Bass Strings</h3>
                    <img class = "small-img" src = "strings-images/bass-string.jpg">
                    <p class = "small-img caption">Close up of bass string. Right side shows nylon fiber bundle.</p>
                    <p>
                        Moving on to bass strings, these strings are made by wrapping some type of metal around bundles of nylon
                        fibers <a href="#source3">[3]</a>. As the strings get lower, the thicknesses of the nylon bundle and
                        wire wrap get larger. This also goes back to that idea of vibration determining pitch. The combination
                        of the nylon core and metal wrap provides a good mass for the string to vibrate at the correct frequency
                        for their pitch and tension level. D’Addario strings all have the same material for this nylon core, but
                        offer mostly two types of metal for the winding: silverplated and 80/20 bronze <a
                            href="#source2">[2]</a>. Silverplated wound strings are made of copper that is then coated in
                        silver, while 80/20 bronze strings are made of an alloy of 80% copper and 20% zinc <a
                            href="#source3">[3]</a>. The difference that material makes in bass strings is a little more obvious
                        than treble strings, which can be shown in the table below.

                    <p>
                        Again, every guitar player has their own personal preference for tone and stretchiness, but silverplated
                        wound strings take the win in clarity, articulation, and corrosiveness. Since 80/20 bronze wound strings
                        do not have that extra layer of silver, they are much more susceptible to rusting from sweat and
                        humidity <a href="#source5">[5]</a>. This rust can also lower the clarity of the string, since bits of
                        rust can lead to disruptions in the vibration which lead to an unpleasant buzzing sound. This also means
                        they need to be replaced more often. Because of how many good qualities silverplated wound strings have,
                        they will usually be the best choice for most guitarists.

                <h2>TENSION</h2>

                <p>
                    Next, we’ll look at the decision of tension level. Each string’s diameter determines its tension. If you
                    have a string with a really small diameter, its tension will be lighter <a href="#source3">[3]</a><a
                        href="#source6">[6]</a>. Then, if you have a string with a high diameter, its tension will be harder <a
                        href="#source7">[7]</a><a href="#source8">[8]</a>. This goes back to the idea of vibration frequency.
                    Say you put the first string on a guitar, and tune it up to E. If you recall that E is determined by a set
                    frequency, a thinner, and as a result more lightweight string, will not need to be pulled as tightly since
                    it will naturally be more flexible. Inversely, an E string with a harder tension will be much thicker, and
                    as a result, needs to be pulled tighter to achieve the same pitch. Returning to our examination of Pro Arté
                    Nylon Core strings, D’Addario offers four tension levels: light, medium, hard, and extra hard <a
                        href="#source2">[2]</a>. The general differences are shown in the table below.

                    <h3>Light Tension</h3>
                    <p>
                        Light tension strings are not the most popular <a href="#source2">[2]</a>, which makes sense since they
                        are not the most versatile. To start with the main advantage of light tension strings, they require the
                        least finger strength out of all tension levels. Since they are so loose on the instrument, you will
                        need less force to press down notes on the fretboard and also to fingerpick. As a result you are also
                        less likely to develop painful calluses or blisters on your fingers, since they tend to be the most
                        gentle on hands <a href="#source9">[9]</a>. In addition, if you prefer a super bright sound, and do not
                        want to hear any darkness in your strings no matter how you play, these strings will tend to be the
                        brightest. However, light tension strings do have the most downsides because of how thin they are. They
                        are the most fragile, the most prone to buzzing <a href="#source9">[9]</a>, the quietest, and the least
                        articulate of all the strings that the D’Addario Pro Arté Nylon Core line offers.

                    <h3>Normal Tension</h3>
                    <p>
                        Next up in tension level is normal tension. Normal tension strings are pretty popular due to how
                        versatile they are <a href="#source2">[2]</a>. These strings will require a little more finger strength
                        than light tension strings, but they will not be completely unmanageable for most guitarists of any
                        level. They do not have a significantly high proneness to buzz, they offer a sufficient amount of
                        articulation, they have pretty good projection volume wise, and they are also a little more sturdy than
                        light tension <a href="#source9">[9]</a>. These strings also have a pretty bright tone, but they can
                        provide a little more versatility depending on your technique <a href="#source9">[9]</a>.

                    <h3>Hard Tension</h3>
                    <p>
                        Going up another tension level, there is hard tension. These are also a popular choice for D’Addario
                        buyers <a href="#source2">[2]</a>. Hard tension strings will offer the best sound, but they tend to be a
                        little more difficult to play. Since they are so stiff, they require a little more finger strength than
                        lighter strings. They also are more likely to give you calluses on your left hand (fretboard side) and
                        your right hand (fingerpicking side) if you do not play with nails. However, if you have been playing a
                        while and you do have nails on your right hand, they will provide a great sound. They can create a
                        variety of tones, from <i>dolce</i> (sweet sound, which is achieved with the right hand near the
                        fretboard) to
                        <i>ponticello</i> (close to the bridge, creating a bright sound). They also are highly articulate, not
                        prone to
                        buzzing, very resistant to snapping, and very projecting in volume <a href="#source9">[9]</a>.

                    <h3>Extra Hard Tension</h3>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the largest tension level is extra hard tension. These are not the most popular <a
                            href="#source2">[2]</a>, as they do not offer that much benefit for the extra playing difficulty to
                        be worth it. Of all of the tension levels that D’Addario offers, they do happen to be the strongest and
                        loudest, but regular hard tension strings are sufficiently strong and loud enough as opposed to these.

                    <h3>What Tension Is Best?</h3>
                    <p>
                        So for beginner guitarists, normal tension strings will be a great choice for a few reasons. First of
                        all, while not being the easiest to play of all four tension levels, they will not be absolutely
                        unbearable for someone who is just starting out. Especially if a beginner guitarist is working towards
                        finger strength, having a little bit of tension will help get their fingers used to playing, and also
                        prepare them for switching to harder strings. It will also give them a perfectly fine sound for starting
                        out, especially for practicing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For more intermediate to advanced guitarists though, hard tension strings will be the best choice. Since
                        guitarists with more experience will have obtained more finger strength – and most likely play with
                        their nails – they would be able to handle the extra difficulty that comes with hard tension strings.
                        These will also provide a great sound that is perfect for performance and recording.

                <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are not sure where to begin, a couple of sets, depending on your skill level, will be a great place
                    to start. For the beginner guitarist, EJ45 strings will usually be the best fit since they have normal
                    tension, clear nylon trebles, and silverplated wound basses. Then, for the more experienced guitarist, EJ46
                    strings will normally be the most well-rounded option since they have hard tension, clear nylon trebles, and
                    silverplated basses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After trying these out, make adjustments based on your own preferences. It is okay if you do not fall in
                    love with the first strings you try. Personally, I did not figure out what strings suited me best until this
                    year – a good thirteen years after I first picked up a guitar. For a little more context, the EJ46 strings
                    are a great fit for me for a couple of reasons. First, I play a 7/8-sized guitar, as opposed to a full-sized
                    one. The extra projection that the hard tension strings provide, especially with silverplated wound basses
                    and clear nylon trebles, helps give me an extra boost for any volume I might lose from playing a smaller
                    instrument. In addition, I love the versatility these strings have, since different tones and timbres can be
                    achieved on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every guitarist has their own preferences when it comes to strings. After experimenting, you might really
                    like the sound of 80/20 bronze bass strings, even if they are more susceptible to rusting and need to be
                    replaced more often. You might even really like the soft sound of light tension strings and actually prefer
                    the quieter volume. At the end of the day, as the musician, it only matters what feel and sound you love.
